# V01 Introduction 
## How input/output is changing 
Human -> Computer 
- Past
  - by design/electronics 
  - wires and switches 
  - punch cards, teletype
- Today 
  - Keyboard
  - Mouse/Touch pad
- Future 
  - speech
  - gestures 
  - touch 
  - eye-gaze
  - EEG, EMG
  - implicit observation/ubicomp
  - emotions
Computers -> Human 
- Past 
  - lamps, led
  - printer, paper
  - screens
- Today
  - TFT screens
  - speaker
- Future 
  - haptic output
  - changing physical
  - environments/ubicomp
  - smell output
  - direct muscle and nerve connection
  - emotions 
## Transforming User Interfaces 
- Learning from past experience 
- Closely observing current technologies and their usage 
- Extrapolation to future interfaces 

- Where to introduce novel UIs
  - Future User Interfaces often start in games 
  - Specific applications
