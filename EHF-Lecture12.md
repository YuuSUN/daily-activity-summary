# Engineering for Human Factors V12: Stress, Workload, Safety
## Lecture Objectives
- Understand the causes of cumulative trauma disorders and how this relates to the physical design of workspaces and tools
- list the types, causes, and consequences of stress
- explain how stree or workload can be estimated
- describe the causes of injuries/death at the workplace
- explain how to perform hazard and saftety analyses
## cumulative trauma disorders
### Risk factors for CTDs
- Pushing, pulling, gripping and lifting
- Repetitive motions
- Awkward or static postures
- Mechanical compression of tissue by using tolls with rough or sharp edges that press against skin of your palm
- Stress, mental or physical
- Fatigue due to insufficient breaks or time for recuperating energy
- Vibration
- Rapid movement of body parts
### Cumulative Trauma Disorders: Ischemia 
- localized tissue anemia 
- due to blood flow obstruction 
- results in tingling and numbness
- e.g. finger ischemia can occur with repeated strong forces to the palm from tool handle 
### Severity
- Cumulative trauma disorders due to performance of repetitive tasks account for more than 50% of all occupational illness in the US today
- Despite the proliferation of keyboards in modern life there has been no increase of CTS. The incidence remains at ~5%
### Warning Sings 
- Numbness and tingling
- Clumsy feeling
- Pain going up into the body
- Pain is worse at night
